     * [dispatch] should be called on the main thread.
     * [dispatch] can be called any time regardless of the application lifecycle.
     * This means that if actions are dispatched after onSavedInstanceState,
     * they will not be saved in case of process death. (similar to the behavior of commitAllowStateLoss).
     * This is usually not a problem if the navigation events come from the UI.
     * But you can alter this behavior by implementing custom lifecycle-aware NavDriveOwner
     * or NavDrive extensions, eg 'forwardDisallowStateLoss'.
