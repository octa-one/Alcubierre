/**
 * Reducer for handling [DeeplinkForward] actions.
 * Uses [DeeplinkResolver] to create actual navigation targets.
 * Support 3 targets:
 * Resolved [Screen] is converted to a [Forward] action.
 * Resolved [Dialog] is converted to a [ShowDialog] action.
 * Resolved [ConditionalTarget] is converted to a [ResolveCondition] action for further processing.
 *
 * Be aware: resolved action will be reduced from the head or chain reducers.
 * So it doesn't matter if [DeeplinkReducer] is at the end or the beginning of the chain.
 * But it's better to place it at the beginning to minimize unnecessary reduce calls.
 *
 * @param resolver [DeeplinkResolver] with all known deeplink, can be created with [DefaultDeeplinkResolver].
 * @param onResolveFailed Callback to handle unknown deeplinks that cannot be resolved by [resolver].
